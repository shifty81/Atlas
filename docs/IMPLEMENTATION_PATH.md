## Status Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Implemented and tested |
| 🔧 | Partially implemented or needs hardening |
| ❌ | Not yet implemented |

## Priority 1 — Determinism Foundation (Critical Path)

These items are prerequisites for network correctness, replay fidelity,
and save/load integrity. They must be completed before any content-facing
milestone ships.

### 1.1 Time Model ✅

**Files:** `engine/sim/TimeModel.h`, `engine/sim/TimeModel.cpp`
**Tests:** `tests/test_time_model.cpp` (8 tests)

Defines three canonical time layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Enters Simulation? |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `SimulationTime` | Fixed-step tick counter | Yes (authoritative) |
| `WorldTime` | In-universe elapsed time with dilation | Yes (read-only in systems) |
| `PresentationTime` | Wall-clock interpolation for rendering | **No** |

**Remaining work:**
- [x] Wire `TimeModel` into `Engine` to replace raw `TickScheduler` delta calls
- [x] Expose `TimeContext` to ECS system callbacks
- [x] Add `WorldTime` dilation controls to editor HUD overlay

### 1.2 Formal World State Model ✅

**Files:** `engine/sim/WorldState.h`, `engine/sim/WorldState.cpp`
**Tests:** `tests/test_world_state.cpp` (9 tests)

Defines state categories:

| Category | Hashed? | Serialized? | Replicated? |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `Simulated` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `Derived` | No | No | No |
| `Presentation` | No | No | No |
| `Debug` | No | No | No |

Provides snapshot/rollback support with configurable history depth.

**Remaining work:**
- [x] Annotate every ECS component with its `StateCategory`
- [x] Enforce category at compile-time via type traits or tag types
- [x] Add snapshot integration to lockstep rollback path in `NetContext`
- [x] Expose state block inspector in editor ECS panel

### 1.3 Save / Load System ✅

**Files:** `engine/sim/SaveSystem.h`, `engine/sim/SaveSystem.cpp`
**Tests:** `tests/test_save_system.cpp` (7 tests)

Provides versioned binary save format (`.asav`) with hash-verified integrity.

**Remaining work:**
- [x] Add save/load commands to editor console panel
- [x] Wire into `Engine::RunClient()` and `Engine::RunServer()` for autosave
- [x] Implement partial-world saves for large streaming worlds
- [x] Add save file browser to editor UI
- [ ] Cross-platform save compatibility testing
- [x] Replay-from-save verification (load save → replay → verify hash ladder)

### 1.4 Determinism Enforcement Hardening ✅

**Files:** `engine/core/contract/AtlasContract.h`, `SimulationGuard.h`,
          `DeterministicRNG.h`, `DeterministicAllocator.h`

Compile-time guards and runtime assertions exist. Gaps remain:

- [x] Add `ATLAS_FORBID_IN_SIM` macro to prevent presentation code in tick
- [x] Enforce `#include` firewall: simulation code cannot include render headers
- [x] Add CMake `INTERFACE` target separating sim-safe from render-safe sources
- [x] FP consistency enforcement (`-ffp-contract=off`, `/fp:strict` flags)
- [x] Platform-dependent math detection in CI (scan for `__m128` outside render)

### 1.5 AI Determinism Contract 🔧

AI systems must produce bit-identical decisions given identical inputs.

- [x] Document allowed randomness sources in AI systems (DeterministicRNG only)
- [x] Serialize planner state for save/load (BehaviorGraph execution state)
- [x] Add determinism test: same AIMemory + inputs → same BehaviorGraph output
- [x] Verify RelationshipModel determinism across save/load boundary

---

## Priority 2 — Engine Integration & Wiring

These items connect the new foundational systems to the existing engine
runtime and editor infrastructure.

### 2.1 Engine Runtime Integration 🔧

- [x] Integrate `TimeModel` into `Engine` class (replace direct `TickScheduler` usage)
- [x] Integrate `WorldState` snapshotting into `Engine::RunServer()` loop
- [x] Integrate `SaveSystem` save/load into `Engine` lifecycle
- [x] Pass `TimeContext` through ECS `Update()` instead of raw `float dt`

### 2.2 Networking ↔ State Integration 🔧

- [x] Use `WorldSnapshot` in lockstep sync instead of raw ECS serialization
- [x] Snapshot-based rollback: restore from `WorldState` snapshot + replay
- [x] Network save/load: server broadcasts save tick, clients verify hash

### 2.3 Replay ↔ Save Integration 🔧

- [x] Verify hash ladder continuity across save/load boundaries
- [x] Implement "replay from save" mode (load save → begin replay playback)
- [x] Add save-point markers in replay files

          `editor/panels/ReplayTimelinePanel.h/cpp`

Core logic exists. Remaining:
- [x] Auto-open divergence view on hash mismatch during replay

- [x] Export divergence report to file

### 3.3 FP Drift Detector ✅

**Files:** `engine/sim/FPDriftDetector.h/cpp`
**Tests:** `tests/test_next_steps.cpp` (6 tests)

- [x] Tool to run identical simulation on two platforms and compare hashes
- [ ] CI job that cross-compiles and verifies golden replay hashes
- [x] Report showing which systems first diverge

### 3.4 Job Execution Trace Viewer ✅

**Files:** `engine/sim/JobTracer.h/cpp`, `editor/panels/JobTracePanel.h/cpp`
**Tests:** `tests/test_job_tracer.cpp` (12 tests)

- [x] Record system execution order each tick
- [x] Editor panel visualizing tick timeline (which system ran when)
- [x] Detect non-deterministic execution ordering

## Lockdown Gate

Atlas reaches **feature-locked** status when all Priority 1 and Priority 2
items are complete and verified per `docs/ATLAS_LOCKDOWN_CHECKLIST.md`.

After lockdown:
- Feature additions require contract review
- Determinism bugs are P0 severity
- All changes must pass golden replay CI gate
